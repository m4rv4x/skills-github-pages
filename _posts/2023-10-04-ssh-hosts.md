Sure! Here is a sample configuration file for the SSH client (`ssh_config`):

```
# SSH client configuration file

# Global settings
Host *
    # Set default options for all hosts
    ForwardAgent yes
    ForwardX11 yes
    PasswordAuthentication yes
    PubkeyAuthentication yes
    ServerAliveInterval 60

# Host-specific settings
Host example.com
    # Set options for a specific host
    User myusername
    Port 22
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa

Host anotherhost.com
    # Set options for another host
    User anotheruser
    Port 2222
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/another_key

Host anotherhost
    # Set options for another host
    HostName dev.example.com
    User anotheruser
    Port 2222
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/another_key

# Add more host configurations as needed
```

You can save this configuration file as `~/.ssh/config` on your Linux/Debian system. Make sure to replace `example.com` and `anotherhost.com` with the actual hostnames or IP addresses of the SSH servers you want to connect to. Also, update the `User`, `Port`, and `IdentityFile` options according to your specific setup.
