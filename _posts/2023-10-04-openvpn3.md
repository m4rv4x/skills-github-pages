Yes, you can connect to your OpenVPN3 server without using the OpenVPN3 client by using the profile.ovpn file. Here's how you can do it:

1. Install the OpenVPN package on your Linux system if it's not already installed. You can do this by running the following command:
   ```
   sudo apt-get install openvpn
   ```

2. Copy the profile.ovpn file to your Linux system. You can use any method to transfer the file, such as SCP or SFTP.

3. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the profile.ovpn file is located.

4. Run the following command to connect to the OpenVPN server using the profile.ovpn file:
   ```
   sudo openvpn --config profile.ovpn
   ```

   Replace "profile.ovpn" with the actual name of your profile file if it's different.

5. Enter your sudo password when prompted.

6. The OpenVPN connection will be established, and you will see the connection logs in the terminal.

Note: Keep in mind that this method assumes you have the necessary permissions and configurations in place on your OpenVPN server to allow connections using profile.ovpn files.
