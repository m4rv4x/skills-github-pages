Yes, there is a command-line tool called "wttr.in" that provides weather information from Google without the need for an API key. You can use it by simply running the following command in your terminal:

```
curl wttr.in
```

This will display the current weather information for your location. You can also specify a specific location by appending it to the command, like this:

```
curl wttr.in/New+York
```

This will show the weather information for New York. You can replace "New+York" with any other location you want to check.
