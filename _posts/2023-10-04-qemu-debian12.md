To install QEMU and run Debian 12 on your Debian 12 system, you can follow these steps:

1. Open the terminal.

2. Update the package lists by running the following command:
   ```
   sudo apt update
   ```

3. Install QEMU by running the following command:
   ```
   sudo apt install qemu-system
   ```

4. Download the Debian 12 ISO image from the official Debian website or any other trusted source.

5. Create a new directory to store the virtual machine files. For example:
   ```
   mkdir ~/debian12-vm
   ```

6. Move the downloaded Debian 12 ISO image to the newly created directory:
   ```
   mv /path/to/debian12.iso ~/debian12-vm/
   ```

7. Change to the directory where you stored the ISO image:
   ```
   cd ~/debian12-vm
   ```

8. Run the following command to start the installation process:
   ```
   qemu-system-x86_64 -boot d -cdrom debian12.iso -m 2048
   ```

   This command will start the QEMU virtual machine with the Debian 12 ISO image as the bootable CD-ROM and allocate 2048MB of RAM to the virtual machine. Adjust the memory allocation as per your requirements.

9. Follow the on-screen instructions to install Debian 12 within the QEMU virtual machine.

Once the installation is complete, you can use QEMU to run Debian 12 on your Debian 12 system by executing the same `qemu-system-x86_64` command with appropriate options and paths to the virtual machine files.

Note: Running a virtual machine may require significant system resources, including CPU, memory, and disk space. Make sure your system meets the requirements to run QEMU and the virtual machine smoothly.
